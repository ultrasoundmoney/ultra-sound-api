# Ultrasound API
This API exposes data generated by the [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money) project for third party integration.

## Development

### Set environment variables
You will have to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to point to a postgres DB containing all the required tables / data. 
Currently this repo does not contain the logic to generate this data so please contact the admins to get access to a suitable dev / staging db instance.

### Build
`cargo build`

### Run
`cargo run` will run the api on `localhost:3000`.
If you want to have auto reload during development install `cargo install cargo-watch` and then run the app with `cargo watch -x run`

### Tests
`cargo test`
